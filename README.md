# MATI (Microstructural Analysis of Tissues by Imaging)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MATI (Microstructural Analysis of Tissues by Imaging) v1.0 is a GPU-accelerated toolbox for microstructural diffusion MRI simulation and data fitting with a user-friendly graphical user interface. MATI runs a Finite Difference simulation to simulate diffusion MRI signals arising from arbitrary modeled microstructural tissues and diffusion pulse sequences. As a general framework for data fitting, MATI fits any user-customized signal model to experimental data to extract parameters with a selection of fitting methods. 

MATI was developed by Dr. Junzhong Xu at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Please send your comments or questions to Junzhong (JZ) Xu (junzhong.xu@vanderbilt.edu)
